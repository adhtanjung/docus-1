## D. Sample Approved AI Prompts

These prompts have been found to produce high-quality, reviewable code.

### Scaffolding a New Module

```text
Create a NestJS module for managing "work-schedules" with:
- A controller with CRUD endpoints following the L1Organization pattern
- A service using PrismaService
- DTOs for Create, Update, and Get operations
- Swagger annotations on all endpoints
Follow the project conventions in instructions.md.
```

### Generating Tests

```text
Write unit tests for the existing L1OrganizationService.create() method.
Cover:
- Successful creation
- Duplicate code handling (ConflictException)
- Missing required fields (BadRequestException)
Use Jest and mock PrismaService.
```

### Refactoring

```text
Refactor the findAll method in PersonService to use the PaginationHelperService.
Keep the existing functionality. Do not change the API contract.
```
