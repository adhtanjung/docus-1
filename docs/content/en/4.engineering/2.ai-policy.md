# AI-Assisted Coding Policy

AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, etc.) are powerful tools that can accelerate development. However, they introduce unique risks if not used with discipline. This policy defines how AI-assisted coding integrates into the HAER engineering workflow.

## Core Principle

::prose-note
**AI is an assistant, not an author of record.** The human developer is always responsible for the correctness, security, and maintainability of all code, regardless of its origin.
::

## Allowed AI Usage

AI tools may be used for the following purposes:

| Use Case                 | Description                                                |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Scaffolding**     | Generating boilerplate, DTOs, or initial module structure. |
| **Refactoring**          | Suggesting improvements to existing code.                  |
| **Test Generation**      | Creating unit and integration tests.                       |
| **Documentation**        | Writing JSDoc, Swagger annotations, or README content.     |
| **Debugging Assistance** | Analyzing stack traces or suggesting fixes.                |

## Prohibited AI Usage

The following practices are **not allowed**:

- **Blindly Accepting Output**: Merging AI-generated code without understanding it.
- **Disabling CI**: Bypassing automated checks because AI code "looks right".
- **Security-Sensitive Generation**: Using AI for auth, crypto, or access control logic without expert review.
- **Mega-PRs**: Allowing AI to generate large, unfocused pull requests.

## AI Usage Disclosure

To maintain transparency and help reviewers calibrate their scrutiny, AI usage should be disclosed.

### Commit Message Tag

Use the `[AI-assisted]` tag in commit messages when AI tools contributed significantly to the code.

```
feat(organization): add L5 validation logic [AI-assisted]
```

### PR Template Field

The standard PR template includes a checkbox:

```markdown
- [ ] AI-assisted code was used in this PR.
```

### Prompt Summary (Optional)

For significant AI contributions, include a brief summary of the prompt or task given to the AI in the PR description.

## Developer Accountability

- **Understand Before Committing**: You must be able to explain every line of AI-generated code.
- **Test Thoroughly**: AI-generated logic requires the same (or higher) test coverage as manual code.
- **Review for Hallucinations**: AI can invent APIs, methods, or patterns that don't exist. Always verify.
- **Own the Bugs**: AI-generated bugs are still **your** bugs.

## Reviewer Responsibility

Reviewers should be aware that AI-assisted PRs may require extra scrutiny in the following areas:

| Focus Area           | Why It Matters                                                         |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Correctness**      | AI may produce plausible-looking but incorrect logic.                  |
| **Over-Engineering** | AI tends to add unnecessary abstractions.                              |
| **Edge Cases**       | AI often misses boundary conditions.                                   |
| **Security**         | AI may introduce vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, improper auth). |
| **Idiomatic Style**  | AI code may not match project conventions.                             |

## Building Institutional AI Knowledge

Over time, teams should document:

- Effective prompts that produce high-quality code.
- Anti-patterns observed in AI output.
- Modules where AI assistance is particularly effective or risky.

This knowledge becomes a valuable engineering asset.
