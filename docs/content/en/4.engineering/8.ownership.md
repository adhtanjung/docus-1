# Ownership & Accountability

Clear ownership is essential for a healthy codebase. This page defines who is responsible for what, and documents common anti-patterns that hurt engineering velocity.

## Code Ownership

### Module Ownership

Every major module in the codebase should have a designated owner or owning team.

| Module                          | Owner                |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------- |
| `src/modules/core/auth`         | Security Team        |
| `src/modules/core/organization` | Core Platform        |
| `src/modules/infrastructure/*`  | Platform Engineering |
| `prisma/` (Schema & Migrations) | Database Lead        |
| `docs/`                         | Documentation Lead   |

### Ownership Responsibilities

- **Review PRs**: Owners are default reviewers for their modules.
- **Architectural Decisions**: Owners approve significant design changes.
- **Quality Assurance**: Owners are accountable for the health of their module.

## Reviewer Responsibility

- **Understand the Change**: Don't approve code you don't understand.
- **Check for Red Flags**: Security, performance, and correctness issues.
- **Timely Feedback**: Respond to review requests within 24 hours.

## Who Owns AI Mistakes?

::prose-note
**AI-generated bugs are still engineering bugs.** The human who committed the code is responsible, not the AI tool.

There is no "the AI wrote it" defense. If you commit it, you own it.

# Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

This section documents common mistakes that cause significant pain for engineering teams. Avoiding these patterns saves months of wasted effort.

## 1. Large "Mega PRs" Generated by AI

**The Problem**: AI tools can generate hundreds of lines of code in seconds. This leads to PRs with 20+ files and 1000+ lines changed.

**Why It's Bad**:

- Impossible to review thoroughly.
- Bugs hide in the noise.
- Reviewers give up and rubber-stamp.

**The Solution**: Break AI output into small, focused PRs. One responsibility per PR.

---

## 2. Merging Code You Don't Understand

**The Problem**: "It works in my tests, so it must be fine."

**Why It's Bad**:

- You can't debug what you don't understand.
- Subtle bugs become production incidents.
- Knowledge debt accumulates.

**The Solution**: If you can't explain a line of code, don't commit it.

---

## 3. Disabling CI to "Just Ship"

**The Problem**: "The tests are flaky, let's skip them for this release."

**Why It's Bad**:

- Flaky tests become ignored tests.
- Real failures get lost in the noise.
- CI becomes untrusted.

**The Solution**: Fix or quarantine flaky tests. Never disable CI.

---

## 4. Blindly Accepting AI Refactors

**The Problem**: AI suggests "improvements" that change working code without clear benefit.

**Why It's Bad**:

- Introduces risk for no gain.
- Makes code harder to trace.
- "Improvement" is subjective.

**The Solution**: Refactors must have a clear, documented purpose.

---

## 5. Long-Running Feature Branches

**The Problem**: A feature branch lives for 3 weeks without merging.

**Why It's Bad**:

- Merge conflicts become nightmares.
- Integration happens late, when fixes are expensive.
- Other engineers can't build on the work.

**The Solution**: Merge early and often. Use feature flags if needed.

---

## 6. Skipping Tests for Generated Code

**The Problem**: "The AI already tested it."

**Why It's Bad**:

- AI-generated tests often don't test the right things.
- Coverage numbers can be misleading.
- Regressions slip through.

**The Solution**: Human-verified tests for all business logic.

## Summary: Quick Reference

| Anti-Pattern    | Quick Fix                             |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| Mega PRs        | Split into < 500 LOC                  |
| Unknown Code    | Read and understand before committing |
| CI Bypass       | Fix the check, not the rule           |
| Blind Refactors | Justify every change                  |
| Long Branches   | Merge within days, not weeks          |
| Missing Tests   | No code without tests                 |
