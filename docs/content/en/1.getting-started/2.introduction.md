## Why HAER?

In today's fast-paced business world, simple spreadsheets or legacy HR systems are no longer enough. HAER differentiates itself through:

### 1. Unified Organizational Model

Manage multi-level hierarchies (L1-L5) and matrix reporting structures. HAER treats the organization chart as a living entity, validating every relationship and change.

```text
L1: Company/Legal Entity
 L2: Division/Business Unit
     L3: Department
         L4: Section/Team
             L5: Unit/Sub-Team
```

### 2. Time-Travel Auditability (Effective Dating)

Every core entity in HAER—from departments to job descriptions—is versioned using a modern **Effective Dating** architecture. This allows you to "go back in time" and see the organization or an employee's profile exactly as it existed on any given date.

### 3. Native Multi-Tenancy

Built from the ground up for isolation. Manage multiple tenants and workspaces within a single deployment, ensuring data privacy and security for all users.

| Level         | Purpose                          | Example             |
| :------------ | :------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Tenant**    | Complete data isolation          | Different companies |
| **Workspace** | Logical separation within tenant | Branches, regions   |

### 4. Headless & Extensible

Built as a modern API-first platform, HAER integrates seamlessly with your existing tech stack. Support for **Custom Fields and Entities** means you can tailor the system to your unique business needs without touching the core code.
