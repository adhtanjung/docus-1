# Job & Position Architecture

HAER distinguishes between **Jobs** (the definition of a role) and **Positions** (the actual slot in the org chart occupied by an employee).

## Jobs

A Job represents a specific role within the organization (e.g., "Full Stack Developer", "HR Manager").

- **Job Code**: Unique identifier.
- **Grade & Level**: Compensation and seniority levels.
- **Description**: Responsibilities and expectations.
- **Competency Profile**: The set of skills required for the job.

## Positions

A Position is a specific instance of a Job assigned to an organizational unit (e.g., "Full Stack Developer in L3-IT-Department").

- **Position Code**: Unique slot identifier.
- **Occupancy**: Can be vacant, occupied, or over-occupied.
- **Reporting**: Positions report to other positions, creating the structural org chart independent of the people in them.

## Competency Framework

HAER's job architecture is integrated with its competency framework:

- **Skills & Proficiencies**: Define what is required for each job.
- **Scale Levels**: (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) with detailed behavioral indicators.
- **Gap Analysis**: Automatically compare an employee's skills against the requirements of their assigned position or a target job.

## Versioning

Like other core modules, Job and Position definitions are versioned via **SCD2**. This allows for "frozen" job descriptions and historical tracking of who held which position at any time.
