# Organization Structure

HAER provides a flexible, multi-level hierarchy to model any organization, from a simple startup to a complex multinational corporation.

## Hierarchical Levels (L1-L5)

The system uses a 5-level structure (L1 through L5) to categorize organizational units. These levels are typically mapped as follows:

1.  **L1 (Organization/Legal Entity)**: The top-level entity, often representing the main company or holding.
2.  **L2 (Division/Region)**: Major business segments or geographical regions.
3.  **L3 (Department/Branch)**: Functional areas or physical locations.
4.  **L4 (Unit/Sub-department)**: Specific teams within a department.
5.  **L5 (Sub-unit/Group)**: Smallest organizational groupings.

_Note: These labels are customizable per tenant._

## Key Features

### SCD2 (Versioned History)

Every organizational unit is tracked using **Slowly Changing Dimensions (Type 2)**. This means:

- You can view the structure of the organization as it existed at any point in history.
- Changes (like renaming a department or moving a sub-unit) create new versions rather than overwriting old data.
- **Valid From** and **Valid To** dates define the period of effectiveness for each version.

### Multi-Workspace Support

Organizational units can be assigned to specific workspaces, allowing for grouped management within a single tenant.

## Organization Codes

Each unit has a unique business code (e.g., `DEPT-IT-001`). These codes are:

- Immutable within a specific timeline.
- Used for integrations and cross-referencing.
- Can be auto-generated or manually specified.

## Relationships

The system maintains parent-child relationships between levels. For example, an L3 department must belong to an L2 division. These relationships are validated to ensure structural integrity.
