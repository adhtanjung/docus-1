# Employee Management

Employee management in HAER is centered around the **Person** entity. It separates personal identity from employment details, allowing for complex scenarios like re-hires or multi-position roles.

## Core Concepts

### Person vs. Employee

- **Person**: The physical individual. Stores static data like name, birth date, gender, and contact info.
- **Employee/Member**: The relationship between a Person and a Workspace/Tenant. Stores professional data like joining date, status, and reporting lines.

## Profile Management

Each employee has a comprehensive profile that includes:

- **Personal Details**: Identity documents, contact information.
- **Employment History**: Tracking all roles held within the organization.
- **Documents**: Secure storage for contracts, IDs, and certifications.

## Reporting Lines

HAER supports flexible reporting hierarchies:

- **Direct Manager**: Primary supervisor.
- **Dotted Line**: Functional or project-based reporting.
- **Matrix Management**: Support for multiple concurrent reporting paths.

## Lifecycle Management

Track the entire employee lifecycle:

1.  **Onboarding**: Capturing initial data and documents.
2.  **Transfers**: Moving employees between organizational units (handled as SCD2 changes).
3.  **Offboarding**: Closing versions and marking records as inactive.

## Security & Privacy

Person data is handled with high sensitivity:

- **Tenant Isolation**: Data is never shared across tenants.
- **Granular Permissions**: Control who can see specific fields (e.g., salary vs. contact info).
- **Audit Logs**: Every access or change to person data is recorded.
