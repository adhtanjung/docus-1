# Performance & Talent

HAER goes beyond administration to help organizations grow their talent and foster a culture of feedback.

## 360 Feedback (R360)

Comprehensive review cycles involving multiple perspectives:

- **Self-Assessment**: Employees reflecting on their own performance.
- **Manager Reviews**: Standard top-down evaluations.
- **Peer & Direct Report Feedback**: Holistic 360-degree views.
- **Custom Templates**: Flexible question types (Likert scale, open-ended, multiple choice).

## Goal Management

Align individual efforts with organizational objectives:

- **OKRs/KPIs**: Define and track progress on key indicators.
- **Milestones**: Periodic check-ins and evidence tracking.

## Talent Marketplace

Promote internal mobility and skill development:

- **Skill Discovery**: Find internal experts based on competency profiles.
- **Opportunity Matching**: Suggest job openings based on employee interests and skill gaps.
- **Learning Path Alignment**: Connect performance gaps to development opportunities.

## Continuous Feedback

Move beyond the annual review with real-time recognition and feedback tools:

- **Shout-outs**: Peer recognition.
- **Growth Notes**: Quick developmental feedback from managers.
